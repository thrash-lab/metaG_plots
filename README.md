# metaG_plots_r.R
R script to generate plots and statistics from metagenomic recruitment RPKM values

This is meant to be run in R studio interactively and has different functions 
commented out depending on which datasets one is analyzing. For example,
the first two read.csv commands toggle between the global (Tara, Biogeotraces, Malaspina)
and coastal (Dead Zone, So Cal Bight) RPKM datasets.
Similar functionality for saving plots and alternating between different subsets of data
occur throughout.
